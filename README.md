## Project Overview

- _**Purpose**_: This project demonstrates my hands-on ability to secure a Windows 10 system in alignment with DISA STIG guidelines. Using a Tenable Nessus STIG scan on an Azure-hosted VM, I remediated high-risk findings and validated the results.
- _**Scope**_: This project focuses on select remediations from the [DISA Microsoft Windows 10 STIG (v3r4)]((https://www.tenable.com/audits/DISA_STIG_Microsoft_Windows_10_v3r4)), prioritized by exploitability, ease of implementation, and system impact.

---

## Initial Scan Results

An initial STIG scan was performed on Tenable which detected numerous policy failures.

## Remediation Steps

1. **Conduct Initial Scan**  
   Run a baseline vulnerability scan using Tenable Nessus with the DISA Microsoft Windows 10 STIG (v3r4) compliance policy.

2. **Analyze Scan Results**  
   Review the scan report to identify failed STIG checks and categorize findings by severity, exploitability, and ease of implementation.

3. **Prioritize Remediations**  
   Select high-impact, low-disruption controls to address first, focusing on those that can be remediated through automated scripts.

4. **Develop and Execute Scripts**  
   Create and run PowerShell scripts tailored to each STIG control to enforce compliance and harden the system.

5. **Perform Post-Remediation Testing**  
   - Verify registry, policy, and service state changes were applied correctly.  
   - Test system stability and critical functionality.  
   - Review Windows Event Viewer and logs for anomalies.  
   - Conduct a follow-up Nessus scan to validate that remediated STIG checks now pass.

6. **Document and Iterate**  
   Record results, update scripts or configurations as needed, and prepare for ongoing compliance monitoring.

## Scripts Directory

The PowerShell remediation scripts are located in the `scripts/` folder. Each `.ps1` file is labeled with the corresponding STIG ID(s) and includes detailed usage instructions and logging output. These scripts were created based on failed controls identified in the initial Tenable STIG scan.

---

## Post-Remediation Scan Results

After running each PowerShell script, a post-remediation scan was performed to validate the STIG checks have passed successfully.

### Impact Summary

After implementing the prioritized STIG remediations, I conducted a post-remediation scan using Tenable Nessus. The initial scan identified **147 failed checks**, whereas the post-remediation scan shows **132 remaining failures**, indicating that **15 findings were successfully resolved** through remediation efforts.

---

## Post-Remediation Testing

After each STIG remediation was applied, the following validation steps were performed to ensure the system remained secure and operational:

- **Verified Registry and Policy Changes**  
  Confirmed registry keys, local security policy settings, and service states were updated as expected.

- **Tested System Functionality**  
  Ensured system boot, login, user operations, and critical applications continued to function without issues.

- **Reviewed Updated Nessus Scan Reports**  
  Re-scanned the system using the Tenable Nessus STIG Compliance policy to validate that the remediated controls no longer appeared as findings.

- **Spot-Checked Operational Logs**  
  Reviewed Windows Event Viewer and `secedit` output for errors or misconfigurations introduced by changes.

- **Performed Rollback Tests (if applicable)**  
  Where feasible, validated the ability to revert changes without disrupting system integrity.

---

## Next Steps (Maintenance Mode)

To maintain a secure and compliant system posture beyond the initial remediations, the following practices will be adopted:

- **Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scans**  
  Perform periodic Tenable Nessus scans to detect newly introduced vulnerabilities and verify compliance over time.

- **Track STIG Updates**  
  Monitor DISA releases for new or revised Windows 10 STIG controls and integrate them into the remediation workflow as needed.

- **Monitor System and Security Logs**  
  Continuously review Event Viewer and audit logs to identify anomalous activity or misconfigurations.

- **Enhance Automation and Reporting**  
  Expand the use of PowerShell scripts for compliance checks and integrate reporting tools for streamlined documentation and audit readiness.
