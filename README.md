# Windows 10 STIG Remediation Repository

This repository showcases how I identified, remediated, and verified Windows 10 (Azure VM) security misconfigurations based on the DISA STIG benchmarks using PowerShell scripts and Nessus vulnerability scans.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: This project demonstrates my hands-on ability to secure a Windows 10 system in alignment with DISA STIG guidelines. Using a Tenable Nessus STIG scan on an Azure-hosted VM, I remediated high-risk findings and validated the results.
- **Scope**: This project focuses on select remediations from the [DISA Microsoft Windows 10 STIG (v3r4)]((https://www.tenable.com/audits/DISA_STIG_Microsoft_Windows_10_v3r4)), prioritized by exploitability, ease of implementation, and system impact.

## Baseline Scan Results

An initial STIG scan was performed on Tenable which detected numerous policy failures. A copy of the initial scan report is available under:

---

## Remediation Steps

1. Perform an initial vulnerability scan using Tenable using the DISA Microsoft Windows 10 STIG (v3r4) policy.
2. Identify failed STIG checks from the initial scan report.
3. Prioritize low-disruption, high-impact items.
4. Create and run PowerShell scripts to automate the remediation.
5. Perform a verification scan to confirm the STIG checks have passed.

## Key STIG Remediations
The table below highlights the STIG remediations that were prioritized based on exploitability, ease of implementation, and system impact. The links provided in the left column lead to more detailed documentation within the `docs/` folder.


| STIG ID(s)                                  | Script Filename                   | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WN10-AU-000500 / -000505 / -000510          | `Set-EventLogSize.ps1`           | Configures Application, Security, and System logs to meet minimum size requirements (32MB, 1000MB, 32MB). |
| WN10-00-000155                              | `Disable-PowerShell2.ps1`        | Disables PowerShell 2.0 to prevent downgrade attacks and enable logging in newer versions. |
| WN10-AC-000005 / -000010 / -000015          | `Set-AccountLockoutPolicy.ps1`   | Enforces account lockout settings: 3 attempts, 15-minute duration and reset period. |
| WN10-AC-000035 / -000040                    | `Set-PasswordPolicy.ps1`         | Enforces strong password policies: minimum 14 characters and complexity enabled. |
| WN10-AC-000030                              | `Set-MinimumPasswordAge.ps1`     | Ensures users cannot change passwords repeatedly in a short time to bypass history restrictions. |
| WN10-CC-000038                              | `Disable-WDigest.ps1`            | Disables WDigest authentication to prevent storage of plain-text credentials in memory. |
| WN10-CC-000180 / -000185 / -000190          | `Disable-AutoPlay.ps1`           | Disables AutoPlay and AutoRun features across all drives to prevent malware propagation. |
| WN10-00-000145                              | `Set-DEP-OptOut.ps1`             | Sets Data Execution Prevention (DEP) to "OptOut" for enhanced runtime memory protection. |
| WN10-00-000175                              | `Disable-SecondaryLogon.ps1`     | Disables the Secondary Logon service to minimize privilege abuse and session hijacking risks. |

## ðŸ“‚ Scripts Directory

Below is a list and summary of each PowerShell remediation script included in the `scripts/` folder. Each `.ps1` file is labeled with the corresponding STIG ID(s) and includes detailed usage instructions and logging output. These scripts were created based on failed controls identified in the initial STIG scan.

- **`Set-EventLogSize.ps1`**  
  Sets minimum log sizes for Application (32MB), Security (1000MB), and System (32MB) event logs to comply with STIG thresholds.

- **`Disable-PowerShell2.ps1`**  
  Disables the legacy PowerShell 2.0 engine, which lacks modern security logging and is vulnerable to downgrade attacks.

- **`Set-AccountLockoutPolicy.ps1`**  
  Enforces account lockout settings: 3 failed login attempts, 15-minute lockout duration, and a 15-minute reset counter.

- **`Set-PasswordPolicy.ps1`**  
  Configures password policy to require at least 14 characters and enables complexity rules (e.g., upper/lowercase, numbers).

- **`Set-MinimumPasswordAge.ps1`**  
  Prevents users from changing passwords too frequently by setting the minimum password age to 1 day.

- **`Disable-WDigest.ps1`**  
  Disables WDigest authentication to prevent Windows from storing cleartext passwords in memory.

- **`Disable-AutoPlay.ps1`**  
  Turns off AutoPlay and AutoRun for all drives and media types, reducing the risk of malware spread via external devices.

- **`Set-DEP-OptOut.ps1`**  
  Configures Data Execution Prevention (DEP) to "OptOut" mode using `bcdedit`, enhancing protection against memory attacks.

- **`Disable-SecondaryLogon.ps1`**  
  Disables the Secondary Logon (seclogon) service, which can be exploited to run elevated commands in user sessions.

## Final Results

After running each PowerShell script, a verification scan was performed to validate remediation success. Updated scan results:

---

## Post-Remediation Testing

After applying each STIG remediation, the followings tasks were completed for post-remediation testing:
- Confirming registry and service state changes.
- Tested system stability and core functionality.
- Reviewed updated scan reports.

## Next Steps (Maintenance Mode)

In addition to addressing these initial vulnerabilities, the next plan of action will be to:
- Continue periodic vulnerability scans 
- Track new/updated STIGs
- Monitor system logs for anomalies
- Expand automation with compliance reporting
